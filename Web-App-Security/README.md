## Web Application Penetration Testing with Hometrumpeter Inc.

**Overview:**  
Conducted a controlled web application penetration test on internal Hometrumpeter applications to identify security gaps, evaluate access controls, and assess overall application resilience.

**Objectives:**  
- Assess authentication and session management for potential vulnerabilities.  
- Test input validation to detect injection or parameter manipulation risks.  
- Identify misconfigurations and weak access control settings.
