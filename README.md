Hands-on cybersecurity projects focused on incident response, IAM, and threat analysis.

**Welcome!**
Hi, I’m Marvelous - a cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience in system administration, IAM, and incident response across hybrid environments. This portfolio showcases my practical projects, attack analysis, and research insights, with an emphasis on **Windows and Linux environments, Active Directory/Entra ID, vulnerability management, and threat monitoring**.
